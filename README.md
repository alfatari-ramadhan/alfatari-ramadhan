## Hey there 👋
I'm Alfatari, a fullstack web developer who learns by building real-world systems.

### 🧠 Learning by Building

I actively learn new technologies and concepts by turning real-world problems
into programming projects.

Most of my projects are case-study driven — focused on understanding business
processes, system workflows, and technical trade-offs rather than just finishing
features.


### 🚧 Case Study Projects

News portal and press management system built as a learning case study.  
Focus areas:
- Editorial workflow
- Role-based access control
- Content lifecycle management  

**Furneka**  
ERP and e-commerce system for a furniture business (case study).  
Focus areas:
- Business process modeling
- Inventory & order flow
- Backend system architecture  

**WO App**  
Wedding organizer booking & vendor management system.  
Focus areas:
- Multi-role user flows
- Scheduling & booking logic
- Data consistency across features


### 🛠️ Tech Stack
